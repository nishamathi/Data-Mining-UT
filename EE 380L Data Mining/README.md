# Data-Mining-UT
This was done as part of graduate coursework at UT Austin. The course Data Mining in EE was taught by Prof. Joydeep Ghosh.

The folder has data and Jupyter notebooks from the 5 homeworks submitted as part of coursework and the project code (team work). The project code only has decision trees and also code for target encoding function created for data pre-processing.
